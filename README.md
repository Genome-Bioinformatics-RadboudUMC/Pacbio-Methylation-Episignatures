# Ivashchenko-Pacbio-Methylation

Repository with scripts used in analyses from: "_Genome-wide methylation detection and episignature analysis using PacBio long-read sequencing_"

## Downsampling

This script downsamples methylation data for two types:  
	1.	Illumina EMSeq / MethylSeq (bedGraph format)  
	2.	PacBio BAM files (long-read data)
